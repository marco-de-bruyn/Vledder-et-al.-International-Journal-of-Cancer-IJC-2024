Abstract
Recent work has shown evidence for the prognostic significance of tumor infiltrating B cells (B-TIL) in high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), the predominant histological subtype of ovarian cancer. However, it remains unknown how the favorable prognosis associated with B-TIL relates to the current standard treatments of primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by chemotherapy  or (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) combined with interval debulking surgery. To address this, we analyzed the prognostic impact of B-TIL in relationship to primary treatment  and tumor infiltrating T cell status in a highly homogenous cohort of HGSOC patients. This analysis involved a combined approach utilizing histological data and high-dimensional flow cytometry analysis. Our findings indicate that while HGSOC tumors pre-treated with NACT are infiltrated with tumor-reactive CD8+ and CD4+ TIL subsets, only B-TIL and IgA plasma blasts confer prognostic benefit in terms of overall survival. Importantly, the prognostic value of B-TIL and IgA plasma blasts was not restricted to patients treated with NACT, but was also evident in patients treated with PDS. Together, our data point to a critical prognostic role for B-TIL in HGSOC patients independent of T cell status, suggesting that alternative treatment approaches focused on the activation of B cells should be explored for HGSOC.
